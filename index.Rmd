# About {-}

This is a short tutorial for constructing species distribution models in R. It describes the whole process from downloading OBIS and GBIF data, generating pseudo-absence data, including environmental data, fitting the model, validating the model and generating the resulting maps for visualization.  

The code is available in [AZTI's github repository](https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/SDM) repository and the book is readily available [here](https://fundacion-azti.github.io/SDM/).
