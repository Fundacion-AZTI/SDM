## SDM

Welcome! 

This is a short tutorial about constructing species distribution models in R, with special emphasis on shape-constrained generalised additive models (SC-GAMs).

The code is available in [AZTI's github repository](https://github.com/Fundacion-AZTI/SDM) repository and the book is readily available [here](https://fundacion-azti.github.io/SDM/).
